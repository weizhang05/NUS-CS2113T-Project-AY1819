== Introduction

FOP Manager is for NUS Freshman Orientation Camp Organizers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing participants' contacts*. More importantly, FOP Manager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FOP Manager can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your "App Name".
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe s/M b/27071999 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/Information Systems g/G1` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
