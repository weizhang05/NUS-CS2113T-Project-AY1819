* This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application targeted at *Project Directors* of *School of Computing Orientation Camps*.
* The application is a useful tool to manage the contacts of organising committee members and participating freshmen. Its features include:
** An easy to use GUI with a list panel displaying contacts.
** Viewing organisers and freshmen separately.
** Viewing condensed reports of the current camp size.
** Random shuffling of freshman grouping.
** Sorting participants according to their groups and houses.
** More features underway, stay tuned!
